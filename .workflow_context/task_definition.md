# Task Definition
We are working on a project to create a GitHub hosted UI to showcase our AI/ML projects. 
The projects are in HTML format of ipynb python notebooks that includes Business Problem, Data Analysis, Machine Learning/AI model training, as well as Business Recommendations. We need to convert them to a GitHub hosted UI that allows users to view the HTML format results and understand the skills that I provide as a potential employee.

## Project Details
Projects are located in the `project_html` directory.
