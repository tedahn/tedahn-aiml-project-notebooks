# Ted Ahn | AI/ML Portfolio

![Project Banner](portfolio-ui/public/abstract_backgrounds/Tech%20Grid.png)

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to my AI/ML Portfolio. This project is a modern, interactive showcase of 6 advanced machine learning projects I completed as part of the **UT Austin McCombs Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** program.

Instead of static notebooks, this portfolio offers a **premium user experience** featuring:
*   **Interactive Modal Design**: Seamlessly browse complex codebases without leaving the visual context.
*   **Modern Reliability**: Built with **React 18, Vite, and TailwindCSS** for high performance and responsiveness.
*   **Visual Storytelling**: Custom glassmorphism UI and data visualization integration.
